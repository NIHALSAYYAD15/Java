1. Implement java program to perform 2*2 matrix addition and multiplication.
2. Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as instance variables- first name, a last name and a monthly salary. Your class should have a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0.0. Write a test application named EmployeeTest that demonstrates class Employee's capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each object's yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display each Employee's yearly salary again.

Create abstract class shape with dim1, dim2 variables and abstract area() method. Class
rectangle and triangle inherits shape class. Calculate area of rectangle and triangle.
6. Create the interface stack which has variable size, abstract methods push (), pop (), display (), overflow () and underflow (). Implement subclass IntegerStack by implementing interface. Create one test class and check for the working of all the methods of IntergerStack class.
7. Implement Following:
Class student with variable rollno, getrollno(), setrollno() methods.
Class test inherits student class and have variables sub1, sub2 and getmarks(), setmarks() methods. Interface sports with variable smarks and set() method.
Class result inherits test class and an implements sport interface and displays that marks.
Demonstrate these classes with application.
8. Develop a mathematical package for Statistical operations like factorial, cube. Create a sub package in the math package -convert. In “convert” package provide classes to convert decimal to octal, binary, hex and vice-versa. Develop application program to use this package.
